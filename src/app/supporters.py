"""Who is thanked in the footer, and how that list is fetched.

Separate from `app.update_flow` despite both being GitHub reads the footer
shows, because they answer to different rules: the update check is only
meaningful for a packaged build and returns early without one, while the
supporters list is the same for every copy of the application including a run
from source.

Lives here rather than beside the strip that displays it for the same reason
`update_flow` does: `ui/` may not import `infra/`, and this is the half that
talks to the network. The widget half stays in `ui/dialogs/update_prompt.py`.
