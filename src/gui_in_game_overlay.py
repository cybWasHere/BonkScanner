"""The in-game overlay component and its composition root.

`InGameOverlayMixin` was seventeen hidden reads -- the second-worst ratio in
the tree, three assignments against thirty-one reads. Ten of the seventeen were
its own widgets, written onto it from `gui_in_game_overlay_settings.py`; the
other seven were four different owners' state discovered through the shared
`self`: the scanner thread, the VOD recorder, the live-run tracker, the two
window-focus helpers on `RunControlMixin`, and the Qt scheduler.

`InGameOverlay` takes those seven as constructor ports and owns the ten
widgets outright, so the class holds no ambient `self` at all. The window, the
timers and the widget geometry stay where step 24's roadmap entry puts them:
the window owns its widgets and its layout, this owns the cadence.

**Every port is a supplier, not a value**, the rule steps 20 and 23 both
follow. `live_run_tracker` is `None` until `initialize_overlay_runtime` runs
and the scanner thread is replaced on every start, so a value captured at
construction would freeze what the app had at build time -- which is what the
mixin's late `self` reads were doing correctly by accident.

The class is not a `MegabonkApp` base. `gui_app.py` keeps thin delegators for
the three external entries measured before the split: `stop_in_game_overlay`
(`gui_scanner.py`'s shutdown path, step 25),
`hotkey_toggle_in_game_overlay_edit` (`gui_run_control.py`'s hotkey binding,
step 25) and the tab, which `gui_layout.py` adds to the tab bar (step 26).
