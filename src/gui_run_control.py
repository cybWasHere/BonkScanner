"""Game window, process and hotkey ownership -- the run-control component.

Step 25 took `RunControlMixin` off `MegabonkApp`. What is left here is one
object that owns two things and borrows the rest through named ports: the
`RunControlProvider` that restarts a run, and the hotkey manager that binds the
three global hotkeys.

The one port worth reading twice is `abort_requested`. Cancellation is the
scanner's: `stop_event` and `scan_event` are its fields, and
`wait_for_game_window_focus` was the only place run control touched either. It
spelled the scanner's `_scan_abort_requested()` out by hand
(`stop_event.is_set() or not scan_event.is_set()`) in two of its own lines,
which is what made the two mixins look like one lifecycle split across two
files. They are not: `stop_event` had exactly one writer and `scan_event`'s
second writer was the pause hotkey, which is a scan-lifecycle operation and
went to the scanner with the rest. The focus wait asks a question; it does not
own the answer.
